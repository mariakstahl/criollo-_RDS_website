Previous research suggests that Criollo cows may be better adapted to hot and dry desert conditions, making them a more sustainable alternative to Red Angus that would allow producers to maintain ecosystem function and health under livestock production. 1.1 Datasets available As part of this project, I am linking together many datasets into one relational database. Each cow as been equipped with GPS collars to track movement, and we have periodically collected morphometric data and fecal samples from the herd. Below are the datasets I have available and am adding to the database: * Cow bread and ear tag ID * Beef metrics (including weights and body condition scores) * Diet sample data * Collar deployment dates * Collars (including brand and serial number) * GPS data (raw from the collars) 1.2 Database structure Below is a schematic of the structure of my relational database. The next chapter will detail how the database was constructed.
